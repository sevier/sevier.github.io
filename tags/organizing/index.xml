      <description>After more than six years of working on energy policy in California and across the country, one of the things that was missing from every flavor of conversation about energy equity or justice or democracy that i was a part of was a shared level of knowledge as a foundational starting point. I was invited into and leading discussions in room after room where sometimes it felt like we couldn&amp;rsquo;t make any progress together because of a whole host of assumptions and varying levels of knowledge that everyone carried into the room and couldn&amp;rsquo;t communicate clearly enough to one another in 60 minutes or less (or 25 minutes after a 35 minute ice breaker).</description>

      <description>In October, i published a new curriculum to aid organizers across the country to better understand the history of the electric utility system and to teach the history to others. My great hope is that it helps deepen our collective understanding of energy and, specifically, electric utility systems.
From doing the research that shaped the curriculum&amp;rsquo;s final contents, i read more than two dozen different texts. Some were more influential than others, and i&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to share a short reading list as a deeper introduction to utility justice.</description>

This week Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s White House announced that the President would encourage mayors and governors - or &amp;ldquo;cities and states&amp;rdquo; - around the country to use unspent American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) dollars to fund police. Not rent relief. Not utility debt relief. Not supplement food assistance. Not even public transit to relieve gas price pressures. More police. And they did it while hinting that it&amp;rsquo;s to provide funding for more cops and overtime pay for those cops to tamp down protest in the summer of 2022, relying on falsified reports about made-up &amp;ldquo;crime wave&amp;rdquo; stories to gin up support for more police.</description>
